# F1_data_science


The ipython notebook deep dives into the cleaning, visualizations, and algorithms run to try and solve a machine learning problem.

The goal is to closely predict the drivers that will finish on the podium.

This is a binary classification problem, I will be exploring logistic regresson with cross validation.

Something I will keep trying to identify is collecting more data and trying to come up with a pipeline.

Try using AWS machine learning tools.

Create some visualizations to cater to a non-technical audience.
